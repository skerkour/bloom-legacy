## Overview

On first launch, user is asked for contacts update.
* If granted, all contacts are imported in Bloom contacts
* Else, nothing is done.

Then each time a conatct is saved,
* if permission is granted, also save on device
* else, only save in Bloom

There is also an option in settings to import contacts (from sim, device or vcf file, JSON),
and to export contacts (vcf file, JSON).
